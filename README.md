# Setup and usage description for Studies protocol to upload endpoint assay data:squirrel:

## :floppy_disk: Downloads
* [Template](template.xlsx)
* [Example submission](example_submission.xlsx)

## :zap: Usage
1. Use the template file to fill in your submission (`.xlsx` or `.csv` only). Take care to preserve the column order.

1. Create new experiment in *Endpoint Data* protocol, type in a name and a description.

1. In the *Data Upload* section click on `+` to upload the data.

   :warning: Check if your browser is not blocking the pop up (applies for first time users of the protocol).

1. *Review* if data is parsed correctly and approve.

1. Upload any other relevant associated files or notes.

1. *Complete & Countersign* the experiment in Studies once finished with the submission to make it available to other Browser forms.

   :warning: Different experimental runs must be submitted as separate *Studies* experiments instead of mashing submission up into one.

:duck: You can remove data by deleting the uploaded document. The data associated will get removed from the system too.

## :bulb: Template column description

| Field | Description | Required |
| -----------: | ----------------- | :----------: |
| `sample_id` | an identifier for a sample tested e.g. compound ID | :heavy_exclamation_mark: |
| `sample_batch` | sample batch number. You should always record batch ID for a compound or biological entity. The only exception can be sequence expressions and can be recorded as 0  | :heavy_exclamation_mark: |
| `target` | the name of the target. In case of ADME assay recorded as ADME, if it's a cell line - record it here | :heavy_exclamation_mark: |
| `assay_name` | name of the assay or protocol | :heavy_exclamation_mark: |
| `assay_type` | type/category of the assay | :heavy_exclamation_mark: |
| `result_type` | result type e.g. IC50, Primary Screen | :heavy_exclamation_mark: |
| `result_alpha` | full result value. This should be a combination of result_modifier and result_numeric. In case a modifier is absent result_numeric will be the same as result_alpha | :heavy_exclamation_mark: |
| `creation_date` | date of the assay | :heavy_exclamation_mark: |
| `data_source` | origin of the records e.g. collaborator, vendor names, in-house | :heavy_exclamation_mark: |
| `eln_id` | ELN ID to link experiment with ELN records. Should be always applicable for in-house experiments | ðŸ¤” |
| `test_id` | a test ID of an assay. Used to distinguish between different repeated runs, especially if done on the same date | ðŸ¤” |
| `study_type` | type of the study assay is associated with e.g. KINASE or ADME or PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION | ðŸ¤” | 
| `gene` | if target is a protein or protein complex please specify a respective gene(s), separated by a dash e.g. JAK2-TYK2 | ðŸ¤”  |
| `organism` | specify target species in Latin |  ðŸ¤” |
| `cell_line` | if cell based assay specify cell line used. In case target is a cell line you end up recording cell line twice. You can refer to ATCC for offical names of cell lines | ðŸ¤”  |
| `result_modifier` | modifier describing numerical result e.g. '>' or '=' |  ðŸ¤” |
| `result_numeric` | numerical value of the assay result |  ðŸ¤” |
| `result_unit` | unit of the result value. In case of micro notation just use regular 'u' instead |  ðŸ¤” |
| `ligand_conc` | ligand concentration and units e.g. 10 uM |  ðŸ¤” |
| `time_step` | time after which assay was recordded e.g. 10 min |  ðŸ¤” |
| `comments` | any other relevant information e.g. conditions, substrate concentrations etc |  ðŸ¤” |
| `study_id` | in-house project identifier associated with the assay |  ðŸ¤” |

## :hammer: Setup
* Setup as a notebook type protocol and link to a form on Browser.
